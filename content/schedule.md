**Workshop with Marina Tsaplina** 

In preparation:

* Bring physical / printed materials/objects (created or found/researched) related to your final project to class. These can be in any order, form; it is not expected that these will be more than fragmentary or partial (certainly more fully realized materials are welcome!). Marina will guide the class through a series of exercises to help students create attentive focus on their idea in order to shift final projects from idea to process to creation/concretization.

**<span style="color:purple;">Disability in the Disciplines Conference</span>**

https://sites.fhi.duke.edu/healthhumanitieslab/disability-in-the-disciplines-conference/

_The field of disability studies suggests that our vulnerabilities and weaknesses are what make us human. Starting from the essential perspective that disability rights are human rights, the study of disability helps us to realize that difference is, perhaps paradoxically, the one thing we all have in common. How do our definitions of “health” shift when we accept that there is no “normal”? How does the centering of disability alter our disciplinary assumptions, and enrich our educational, medical, legal, and artistic practices?  Explore these questions at “Disability in the Disciplines,” a two-day conference at Duke University on April 25-26, 2019_
