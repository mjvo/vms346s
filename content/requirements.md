* Ability to engage thick description and personal reflection in response to an experience of an image, text, performance, fieldtrip, or expert visit.
* Ability to draw together personal response with critical analysis from other scholars and creative materials from other artists culminating in a piece of creative scholarship that engages individual research and reflection.
* Improved comfort with and varied approaches to collaboration and offering critical feedback skills for peers' and personal creative and academic work.

## Grade Distribution

1. **In-Class Participation**

    25% of grade

    The success of this seminar depends on your in-class participation. Students are expected to attend all classes and actively discuss and respectfully debate the class themes and readings.  You are allowed one unexcused absence without penalty. Absences beyond this, without documentation or advance consultation with your instructors, will result in **a participation grade penalty of 1/3 of a letter grade for each unexcused absence.**  Chronic lateness and/or absences may also impact your final course grade.

    If you find you will be missing class or running late on a date when either you have in-class group work or we will be meeting somewhere other than our classroom, you must notify your instructors to avoid an impact on your participation grade.

    Only submit a STINF form for illnesses that will keep you out of class for a full week or more. Remember a STINF simply notifies an instructor you will be absent; it does not necessarily negate the ramifications of such an absence.

1. **“Object Lessons” Journal Posts**

    20% of grade   
    
    One of the goals of the class is to develop a new awareness of the ubiquity of medical images and medical ways of seeing in our contemporary visual culture. _Each week, students will write a reflection on a “found object” (image, artwork, technology, artifact) from medicine’s visual culture, contextualized in relation to that week’s readings._  How do the assigned readings help you better understand a particular facet of medicine’s visual culture and/or see in a new light?  Or, conversely, how does a particular object change your understanding of the readings or challenge an author’s point of view?   (Minimum: 250 – 300 words each post; evaluations based on consistent, timely posting as well as general clarity and focus.)
 
    Furthermore, as a way to sustain and extend our in-class conversations, _students must respond to a different classmate’s post at least three times during the semester_ (once in January, once in February, once in March/April).  Choose a blog post to respond to that does not yet already have any other student responses.

1. **Reading Précis**

    10% of grade   
    
    Each student will be assigned responsibility for writing <span style="text-decoration: underline">one</span> 2-page _précis_ on a particular reading.  These _précis_ should:
    
    * identify the author (2-4 sentences that give the context for their expertise);
    * situate the reading within the broader themes of the course (one paragraph);
    * highlight key themes and arguments within the reading; and
    * pose two (2) or more questions for in-class discussion.
    On the day your _précis_ is due, please come to class with printed copies to share with your classmates.  Expect that your professors will call on you to assist with leading discussion on your assigned reading.

1. **Show and Tell / Archives Speak: History of Medicine Collection**

    5% of grade 

    One of our class sessions will be held in the Rubenstein Library’s History of Medicine Collection where we will explore historical artifacts from medicine’s visual and material culture.   In this assignment, each student will choose one artifact and from its point of view or the point of view of its user, creator or its recipient/audience write a 300-350 word monologue or poem with an accompanying illustration or avatar for the item. You will be asked to create a context or encounter for the item; select first, second, or third person for the point of view, and think of the experience or knowledge that the item carries with it into the situation you’ve crafted. Think of whether your writing is set within the item’s historical time/use or from the now of your interaction with it in the archive or from some time/place in-between.

1. **Graphic Medicine Annotation**

    15% of grade

    In this assignment, students will engage in a practice of visual rhetoric: an analytical approach where word and image come together to illustrate cultural meanings as well as aesthetic values.  Specifically, students will draw on the intertextual writing conventions of Harper’s Weekly magazine’s “Annotation” feature (see, e.g. https://harpers.org/archive/2013/09/helter-seltzer/).  Each student will annotate a panel or panel sequence from a medical education comic, a genre known as “graphic medicine.”

1. **Semester Project**

    25% of grade

    Students are expected to complete a semester project in a medium other than but equivalent to a 15 – 18 page research paper. The details of the final project will be made available in class at a later date, but we encourage you to think broadly about performance and visual media – mount an art installation, perform a monologue, produce a video, make a game. Creativity and analytic rigor can go hand in hand!
