## Course Description

Contemporary medicine trades in **images**: the anatomical atlas, radiographic X-rays, PET, MRI and CT scans, electrocardiograms, fetal sonograms, and endoscopic exploration of the human viscera. This course explores the myriad **visual cultures of medicine**, with a particular focus on the changing role of **diagnostic visuality** and imaging in contemporary medical practices, as seen from various philosophical, historical and disciplinary perspectives.

Of primary interest will be consideration of what might be considered the specificities of the **medical gaze**, medical ways of seeing and the connections between these **professional** ways of seeing and **popular** modes of visuality such as photography, cinema, television, comics/graphic novels, and computer graphics and gaming. How does the visual culture of medicine “bleed” into popular culture and the public’s imagination, and vice versa?   We will also examine the relationship between images and **embodiment**: how do visual cultures of medicine construct normative standards and how do those normative standards affect the lived experience of individuals with conditions that require medical expertise, support, diagnosis? We will look at the discourse of eugenics as a central example of the intersection among medicine’s diagnostic imagination, social constructs, and economic systems.
